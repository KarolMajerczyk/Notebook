<details><summary>Basic HTML and HTML5</summary>

HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser. HTML elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, different elements can describe text as a heading, paragraph, or list item. HTML elements are the building blocks of any webpage.

Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag. The only difference between opening and closing tags is the forward slash after the opening bracket of a closing tag.

For example this is a heading element with opening and closing tag:

```html
<h1>Main heading element</h1>
```

Heading element tells the browser about the structure of your website. h1 elements are often used for main headings, while h2 elements are generally used for subheadings. There are also h3, h4, h5 and h6 elements to indicate different levels of subheadings.

```html
<h2>2-level heading element</h2>
<h3>3-level heading element</h3>
<h4>4-level heading element</h4>
<h5>5-level heading element</h5>
<h6>6-level heading element</h6>
```

The p element is the preferred element for paragraph text on websites. p is short for "paragraph".

```html
<p>Paragraph element</p>
```

Note: As a convention, all HTML tags are written in lowercase, for example <p></p> and not <P></P>.

Web developers traditionally use lorem ipsum text as placeholder text. The lorem ipsum text is randomly scraped from a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome. Lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.

Commenting is a way that you can leave comments for other developers within your code without affecting the resulting output that is displayed to the end user. Commenting is also a convenient way to make code inactive without having to delete it entirely.

```html
<!-- HTML comment -->
```
