<details><summary>Basic HTML and HTML5</summary>

HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser. HTML elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, different elements can describe text as a heading, paragraph, or list item. HTML elements are the building blocks of any webpage.

Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag. The only difference between opening and closing tags is the forward slash after the opening bracket of a closing tag.

For example this is a heading element:

```html
<h1>Heading</h1>
```

</details>

```javascript

```
