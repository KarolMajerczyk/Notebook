<details><summary>Intro</summary>

Developers use two main languages to build webpages:

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design

<details><summary>Basic HTML and HTML5</summary>

HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser. HTML elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, different elements can describe text as a heading, paragraph, or list item.
